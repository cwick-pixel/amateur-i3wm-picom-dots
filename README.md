Some amateur dotfiles for my current rice on arch linux. 
Had to use some chatgpt to help since I don't even code at all XD. Enjoy my rice!

The polybar pop-up calendar script I used can be found here:
https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts/tree/master/polybar-scripts/popup-calendar

The battery-arch script is a modified version of the battery script provided in the main polybar repository. 
I only followed the directions relating in the Configuration section.

Here is the github repo:
https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts/tree/master/polybar-scripts/battery-combined-udev

Make sure that the file paths line up correctly! Failure to do so might lead to the rice not working correctly!

Thank you! <3
